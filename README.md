# VGG-face-gender

This is a mini-project I completed recently. The goal was to convert a model to tensorflow and finetune it. 

The model was the VGG Face Descriptor model from http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/vgg_face/, and the finetuning was to make it predict gender from frontally aligned face images  http://www.openu.ac.il/home/hassner/Adience/data.html#agegender

The Readme.txt file explains my work, with the final model given in final_gender_model.py
